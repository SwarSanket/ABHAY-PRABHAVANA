              The magnificent 13.2 m (43 feet) installation of first Tirthankar
              Rishabhdev, in meditation pose, is placed at the end of the
              Festival Walk. This statue draws inspiration from the Art Deco
              style â€“ a unique and contemporary interpretation of the Tirthankar
              statues, as against the traditional depictions. All around the
              statue are murals depicting the teachings of the founder of our
              civilization - Tirthankar Rishabhdev and inspiring stories of
              achievements of his daughters Brahmi and Sundari, as also his sons
              Bharat and Bahubali.
